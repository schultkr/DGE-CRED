\section{Economic Models and Climate Change}

\subsection{Motivation}
%\subsection{Key characteristics}
\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Motivation: Training goals}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Inclusion of climate change and potential adaptation measures as variables in macroeconomic models to conduct adaptation policy evaluation. 
		\item A sustainable implementation of the developed model.		
		\item Relationship between climate and the economy needs to be continuously monitored.
		\item Allow for modification of the model for specific policy questions, i.e. right balance between sophistication and simplicity.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Modeling Approach}

\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Overview of Modeling Approaches}
	\begin{itemize}	
	\item Macroeconomic models are commonly top-down approaches to model the economy.
	\item There are three broad categories of macroeconomic models used for modeling the interaction of climate and the economy.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Input-Output models 
		\item Macro-econometric models
		\item General Equilibrium models (CGE)
	\end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Input Output Models}
	\begin{itemize}	
	\item \cite{miller2009input} contains a chapter for environmental input-output analysis.
	\item Input Output models are based on national accounts and the respective supply and use tables.	
	\item Input-Output models are very useful to study sectoral inter dependencies.
	\item IO tables are not available on a sub national level.
	\item Long-term adjustment costs are overestimated using static IO models.
	\end{itemize}	
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Macro-econometric Models}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \cite{hsiang2016climate} provides an excellent overview of climate econometrics.
		\item One can e.g. combine IO models with econometrics to conduct simulation studies. 
		\item Estimated parameters for the goods and labour market are used to inform the model about price changes.
		\item The estimated behavioral equations are less valid the greater the simulation horizon.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} General Equilibrium Models}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For a comprehensive introduction to the main principles of general equilibrium models see \cite{wing2004computable}.
		\item The class of General Equilibrium models relies on the principle of optimizing agents. 
		\item The system of equations is derived from optimization problems of households and firms.
		\item One can distinguish between static and dynamic General Equilibrium models. 
		\item For dynamic General Equilibrium models one can use back-ward looking or forward-looking expectations.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} General Equilibrium Models}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \cite{arndt2015economic} is an excellent example on how to use CGE models to evaluate the impact of climate change on the economy.
		\item The study uses a computational dynamic general equilibrium model for Vietnam.
		\item Different climate change scenarios are simulated.
		\item Climate change affects the evolution of sectoral productivity, e.g. increase in temperature alternates rice crop yields.
		\item Our approach shares many features.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Our Approach}
	\begin{itemize}	
	\item We use a \textbf{dynamic general equilibrium (DGE) framework }, where 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the model equations are explicitly derived from the optimization behaviour of representative agents.
		\item Due to the dynamic nature of the model, the optimal decisions are derived at every point in time and thus show optimal reactions of agents to changing fundamentals.
		\item Thereby, the model provides a consistent framework for the interpretation of domestic and foreign economic shocks and the channels through which they affect variables.
	\end{itemize}		
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Key characteristics of the model (1)}
	\begin{itemize}
		
	\item Small open-economy model
	\item Non-stationary model with direct mapping to statistical variables
	\item Regional and sectoral perspective:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item	Regional and sectoral shares of output, employment, wage bill
	\item	Regional and sectoral production functions
	\end{itemize}
	\item National perspective:	population, national output, taxes, government expenditure
	\item	Three different agents: firms, households and government
	\item	Climate variables are exogenous to economic variables:\\
	{\small{Temperature, wind speed, precipitation and sea level}}
		
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

   
   
   \begin{frame}<presentation>
   	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Key characteristics of the model (2)}
   	  	\begin{itemize}
   		
   		\item The impact of climate (change) on the economy is modeled with the help of so-called ``damage functions''.
   			\item These sector and/or region-specific equations link climate variables to economic outcomes. ``Damage'' in that context refers to the fraction of potential production ``lost'' due to climate (change).  
   		\item Sectoral damage functions are calibrated based on particular sub-models that translate climate related events into economic impacts.
   		\item We will use results from the literature and econometric methods to calibrate the damage functions.
   	\end{itemize}
   \end{frame}

   
\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Key characteristics of the model (3)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item DGE models can easily be built and run in Dynare, an \textbf{open source} pre-processor for Matlab (and its open-source alternative Octave) that is \textbf{continuously supported online} and widespread used. 
\item	Dynare allows the user to simulate and estimate the underlying structural model. It is also possible to run Dynare with other open source software such as Julia, Python or R.
\item Translating model equations into Dynare code is \textbf{intuitive}.  
\end{itemize}

   		

\end{frame}

\subsection{Advantages of the modeling approach}
\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Advantages and limitations of the modeling approach}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item The number of regions and sectors can be modified.
		\item Extensions to the baseline model can be tested easily. 
		\item Our damage functions allow a transparent and replicable approach to include climate into the model.
		\item Expectations are formed model consistent.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame} 
	
	
\subsection{Limitations of the modeling approach}
\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Advantages and limitations of the modeling approach}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Demand for computational power increases tremendously with the number of regions and sectors. Therefore the number  factors is smaller compard to IO models and static CGE models
			\item Deviations from perfect foresight setup is not straightforward.
			\item Specifying a functional relationship between climate and sectoral productivity restricts the functional form considered.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame} 	
	
	

%\begin{frame}<presentation>
	%\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Advantages of the modeling approach}
	%\begin{itemize}
		%\begin{small}
		%\item Parameters can either be calibrated based on comparable studies, economic theory as well as period averages of actual data or be estimated using data up to the most recent period.
%%			%In contrast parameters of CGE models are commonly calibrated or estimated equation by equation ignoring potential collinearities of parameters. Dynare can estimate the linearized version of the model with Bayesian techniques or the nonlinear model using general method of moments or simulated method of moments. 
	%\item It is possible to track the transition dynamics from the initial state to the final state. It shows precisely how the economy ``reacts''  to the induced changes. 
	%\item DGE models allow for the possibility of (transitory) disequilibria, e.g. unemployment or under-utilization of installed capital, %whereas within CGE models resources can only “move” between sectors and regions.   
	%\item DGE models are parsimonious and more frequent updates are possible with respect to data requirements
	%\item DGE models can be estimated (and simulated) with a subset of the data. %	. Whereas CGE models require a large dataset that consistently describes the whole economy,Furthermore, CGE models are ultimately based on input-output tables that are published less frequently and with a huge delay than national accounts data. 
%%
	%\item DGE models are estimated on the basis of national accounts data, and hence, they are capable to gauge the initial state of the economy, i.e. before climate change or adaptation policies come into effect, timelier and more precisely. 
	%\item Translating model equations into Dynare code is intuitive

\subsection{Possible applications}

\section{Model building steps}

\subsection{Identification of Climate Hazards}


\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Define Climate Change Scenarios}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item First, it is necessary to obtain climate change scenarios for Vietnam.
		\item We use results from \cite{thuc2016climate} to define regional specific climate change variables.
		\item It is possible to define regional specific paths for:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item annual average temperature 
				\item annual average precipitation
				\item sea level rise
			\end{itemize}
		\item To include weather extremes we need to define the relationship between annual averages and the frequency of weather extremes, e.g. 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item cyclones
				\item droughts
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Data for model calibration}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Based on identified damages and potential losses in previous studies one can calibrate functional forms of the damage functions
		\item Climate change will affect economic sectors to a different extent: Previous studies show a high potential impact of agriculture, electricity markets and transportation
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Modeling Steps}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In order to gauge the impact of climate change on economic outcomes, deterministic simulations are conducted.
	\item Different climate change scenarios need to be defined first, e.g. long-term projections for temperature or the sea level. 
	\item The model is simulated from its initial condition along the assumed climate change path.
	\item Simulation results then show the adjustment processes to climate change in the economy.
	\item Further, it is possible to specify adaptation measures reducing the impact of climate change on the damage function. %Adaptation measures such as building damns will increase government expenditures to tackle climate change.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Modeling Steps}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item An increase in government expenditures related to adaptation measures will reduce the available funds for other projects% like education with implications on long-run economic growth and human capital formation.
	\item Further, it is possible to reallocate economic activity from regions very likely to be severely affected by climate change to regions with a lower exposure to climate change. A relocation of economic activity will very likely reduce productivity today to reduce potential damages in the future. This also applies to shifts from productive activities between economic sectors.
	\end{itemize}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	Geometric average annual growth rate set to 4 percent  
			\item 		Determine sectoral TFP shocks to match an assumed new long-run composition of gross value added by economic activity (agriculture 1 percent, industry 35 percent, services 65 percent)
			\item 	Long-run dynamics of labour productivity to ensure employment shares converge to values observed for developed economies
			\item 		Exogenous evolution of sectoral labour and total factor productivity is completed after 120 periods

\section{Introduction to Dynare}

\subsection{What is Dynare?}
\begin{frame}<presentation>
\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} What is Dynare?}
  \begin{itemize}
		\item Dynare is an open-source program for dynamic general equilibrium modeling:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item mainly a collection of different functions written for MATLAB
			\item preprocessor translates mod-files into MATLAB code
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Implementing a Model in Dynare}
\subsubsection{Model File}
\begin{frame}<presentation>[fragile]
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection\thinspace\thesubsubsection} Model File}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A model file or mod-file (filename.mod) contains commands and blocks. Each command and each element of a block is terminated by a semicolon (;). Blocks are terminated by \texttt{end;} .
		\item The model file complementary to these slides is \textit{Introduction\_Dynare.mod}.
		\item Code lines within the mode file can be deactivated using \%, // or /* ... */.
		\item In order to run a model file:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The Dynare path has to be added to the search path of MATLAB.
				\begin{verbatim}
				   addpath('C:\dynare\4.6.1\matlab')
				\end{verbatim}
			\item Dynare executed to run the model in MATLAB.
				\begin{verbatim}
				   dynare filename
				\end{verbatim}
		\end{itemize} 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\subsubsection{Neoclassical Growth Model}
\begin{frame}<presentation>
\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection \thinspace\thesubsubsection} Neoclassical Growth Model (1)}
	 \begin{itemize}
	 	\item In order to illustrate the basic structure of Dynare, the following neoclassical growth model is considered in this section:
	 	\begin{gather*}
	 	\underset{\left\{ c_t, \thinspace k_t\right\} _{t=1}^{\infty}}{\max} = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \beta^{\thinspace t-1} \thinspace \frac{c_t^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma}\\
	 	\text{s.t.} \quad c_t + k_t = A_t \thinspace k_{t-1}^{\alpha} + (1-\delta) \thinspace k_{t-1}
	 	\end{gather*}
	 	\item It follows from the first order condition of the above problem with respect to consumption that the Lagrange multiplier is defined as  $$\lambda_t=\beta^{\thinspace t-1}\thinspace\sigma_t^{-\sigma},$$ representing the marginal utility of consumption.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection \thinspace\thesubsubsection} Neoclassical Growth Model (2)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The resulting first order conditions are:
		\begin{gather*}
		c_t^{-\sigma} = \beta \thinspace c_{t+1}^{-\sigma} (\alpha \thinspace A_{t+1} \thinspace k_t^{\alpha -1} + 1 - \delta)\\[5pt]
		c_t + k_t = A_t \thinspace k_{t-1}^\alpha + (1-\delta) \thinspace k_{t-1}
		\end{gather*}
		\item By the definition $c_t=c_{t+1}=\bar{c}$ and $k_t=k_{t+1}=\bar{k}$ has to hold in the steady state.
		\item Therefore, the first order conditions in the steady state case become:
		\begin{gather*}
		\bar{c}^{-\sigma} = \beta \thinspace \bar{c}^{-\sigma} (\alpha \thinspace \bar{A} \thinspace \bar{k}^{\alpha -1} + 1 - \delta)\\[5pt]
		\bar{c} + \bar{k} = \bar{A} \thinspace \bar{k}^\alpha + (1-\delta) \thinspace \bar{k}
		\end{gather*}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection \thinspace\thesubsubsection} Neoclassical Growth Model (3)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The steady state can be obtained analytically by solving the first equation for $\bar{k}$ and the second equation for $\bar{c}$:
		\begin{gather*}
		\bar{k} = \bigg(\frac{1-\beta (1-\delta)}{\beta\thinspace\alpha\bar{A}}\bigg)^\frac{1}{\alpha -1}\\[5pt]
		\bar{c} = \bar{A} \thinspace \bar{k}^\alpha - \delta \thinspace \bar{k}		
		\end{gather*}
		\item The neoclassical growth model considered in these slides, as well as the \linebreak DGE-CRED model are \textit{deterministic models}. There are no stochastic elements requiring expectancy terms or probability distributions. Therefore, the remained of this introduction to Dynare focuses on this class of models.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\subsubsection{Variables and Parameters}
\begin{frame}<presentation>[fragile]
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection\thinspace\thesubsubsection} Variables and Parameters (1)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item At the beginning of each model file, the endogenous (\texttt{var}) and exogenous (\texttt{varexo}) variables as well as parameters (\texttt{parameters}) have to be defined:
			\begin{verbatim}
			   var = c k;		
			   varexo = A;		
			   parameters alpha_p beta_p gamma_p delta_p;	
			\end{verbatim}	
		\item Then, the parameter values have to be assigned:
			\begin{verbatim}				
			   alpha_p = 0.5;
			   beta_p = 0.95;
			   gamma_p = 0.5;
			   delta_p = 0.02;
			\end{verbatim}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}<presentation>[fragile]
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection\thinspace\thesubsubsection} Variables and Parameters (2)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Optionally, a LaTeX name and long name can be assigned to a variable using the convention:\\ 
		\begin{verbatim}
		variable_name $tex_name$ (long_name = 'quoted_string') \end{verbatim}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Example:
		\begin{verbatim}
		  var 
		  k $k$ (long_name = 'capital'),
		  c $c$ (long_name = 'consumption');
		  
		  varexo 
		  A $A$ (long_name = 'technology');
		\end{verbatim}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}<presentation>[fragile]
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection\thinspace\thesubsubsection} Variables and Parameters (3)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item There are some restrictions to kept in mind, when choosing variable and parameter names in Dynare:
			\begin{itemize} 
				\item Avoid names of built in functions and commands.
				\item Minimize interface with Matlab or Octave functions.
				\item Example: Do not use correctly-spelled greek letters like \texttt{beta}.
			\end{itemize}
		\item Note that by convention in Dynare, the time indice of a variable reflects when this variable is decided. The typical example is for capital stock:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Since the capital stock entering the production function in the current period is decided in the previous period, the capital stock becomes \texttt{k(-1)}, and the law of motion of capital must be written: \texttt{k = i + (1-delta)*k(-1)}. 
				\item This convention can be modified using the \texttt{predetermined\_variables} setting.
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\subsubsection{The \texttt{model} block}
\begin{frame}<presentation>[fragile]
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection\thinspace\thesubsubsection} The \texttt{model} block}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A model is declared inside a \texttt{model} block. In general, there must be as many equations as there are endogenous variables in the model. A great advantage of using Dynare is that the equations can be written almost as on paper.
		\begin{verbatim}
		   model;
		   c + k = A*k(-1)^alpha_p + (1-delta_p)*k(-1);
		   c^(-gamma_p) = beta_p*c(+1)^(-gamma_p)
		           *(alpha_p*A(+1)*k^(alpha_p-1) + 1 - delta_p);
		   end;
		\end{verbatim}
		\item Now, the model is set up and one can begin with the deterministic simulation. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\subsection{Steady State in Dynare}
\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Steady State (1)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item By definition a steady state of a model satisfies: $$y_t=y_{t+1}=\bar{y} \enspace \text{and} \enspace u_t=u_{t+1}=\bar{u},$$
		where $y$ is the vector of endogenous variables and $u$ the vector of exogenous shocks.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In the context of the neoclassical growth model: $y_t=(c_t \quad k_t)'$ and $u_t=A_t$.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Note that a steady state is conditional to:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The steady state values of exogenous variables $\bar{u}$.
			\item The values of parameters (implicit in the above definition).
		\end{itemize}
		\item Even for a given set of exogenous and parameter values, some (nonlinear) models have several steady states.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Steady State (2)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The steady state is an important concept in the framework of the DGE-CRED model:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In this model it is assumed that the economy is a steady state at the beginning of the initial period and then transits towards a different steady state, reached in the terminal period.
			\item While the trajectories of the exogenous variables are given, those of the endogenous variables are determined within the model.
		\end{itemize}
		\item There are three approaches to calculate the steady state in Dynare.
		\item The steady state values are stored in the MATLAB matrix \texttt{oo\_.steady\_state}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}<presentation>[fragile]
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Steady State: Approach 1}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Idea: Provide an initial guess for the steady state in the \texttt{initval} block and then conduct the steady state calculation using \texttt{steady}.
		\item Example, considering the neoclassical growth model:
		\begin{verbatim}
		   initval;
		   c = 2;
		   k = 30;
		   A = 1;
		   end;
		   steady;
		\end{verbatim}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}<presentation>[fragile]
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection} Steady State: Approach 2}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Idea: Use a \texttt{steady\_state\_model} block, in which the steady state values are calculated. 
		\item Example, considering the neoclassical growth model:
		\begin{verbatim}
		   initval;
		   A = 1;
		   end;		
		   steady_state_model;
		   k = ((1 - beta_p*(1 - delta_p))/
		          (beta_p*alpha_p*A))^(1/(alpha_p - 1));
		   c = A*k^alpha_p - delta_p*k;
		   end;
		\end{verbatim}
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Idea: Use an explicit steady state file, which is an external MATLAB-file that must conform with a certain structure and naming convention:\\ \texttt{NAMEofMODfile\_steadystate.m}. 
		\item In this steady state file, you must provide the exact steady state values as in the case of the \texttt{steady\_state\_model} block.
		\item Advantage: Flexibility, can call build-in MATLAB functions, allows for changing parameters to take parameter dependencies into account without resorting to model-local variables.
		\item Drawback: The additional flexibility offered by a steady state file increases the scope for errors.
		\item Note: A steady state file is used in the DGE-CRED model.

	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection\thinspace\thesubsubsection} Deterministic Simulation (1)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The deterministic simulation builds up on the concept of \textit{perfect foresight}, in which agents have full knowledge and perfectly anticipate all future shocks.
		\item More precisely, we assume that:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item agents learn the value of all future shocks;
			\item since there is shared knowledge of the model and of future shocks, agents can compute their optimal plans for all future periods;
			\item optimal plans are not adjusted in periods 2 and later\\ $\Rightarrow$ the model behaves as if it were deterministic.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Cost of this approach: The effect of future uncertainty is not taken into account.
		\item Advantage: Numerical solutions can be computed exactly (up to rounding errors) and nonlinearities are fully taken into account.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection\thinspace\thesubsubsection} Deterministic Simulation (2)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The general problem in the deterministic, perfect foresight, case can be expressed as: $$f(y_{t+1},y_t,y_{t-1},u_t)=0,$$ where $y$ is the vector of endogenous variables and $u$ the vector of exogenous shocks.
		\item Identification rule: There must be as many equations in $f(...)$ as there are endogeneous variables in $y$.
		\item The general perfect foresight problem for the neoclassical growth model is:
		\begin{gather*}
		f(y_{t+1},y_t,y_{t-1},u_t) = \begin{pmatrix} 	c_t^{-\sigma} - \beta  \thinspace c_{t+1}^{-\sigma} (\alpha \thinspace A_{t+1}  \thinspace k_t^{\alpha -1} + 1 - \delta)\\ c_t + k_t - A_t  \thinspace k_{t-1}^\alpha - (1-\delta)  \thinspace k_{t-1} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
		0 \\0
		\end{pmatrix},
		\end{gather*}
		where $y_t = (c_t \enspace k_t)'$ and $u_t = A_t$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection\thinspace\thesubsubsection} Deterministic Simulation (3)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The aim of a deterministic simulation is to examine the trajectories of the model variables over the time period $t = 1,...,T$. 
		\item Consequently, the stacked system for a perfect foresight simulation over $T$ periods becomes a two-boundary value problem: 
		$$\left\{ \begin{matrix} f(y_2,y_1,\mathbin{\textcolor{red}{y_0}},\mathbin{\textcolor{blue}{u_1}})=0 \\ 
		f(y_3,y_2,y_1,\mathbin{\textcolor{blue}{u_2}})=0 \\ 
		\vdots \\ 
		f(\mathbin{\textcolor{red}{y_{T+1}}},y_T,y_{T-1},\mathbin{\textcolor{blue}{u_T}})=0 
		\end{matrix},  \right.$$ 
		where $y_0$ and $y_{T+1}$ as well as $u_1,...,u_T$ are given.
		\item Dynare uses a Newton-type methode to solve this stacked system.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection\thinspace\thesubsubsection} Deterministic Simulation (4)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The Newton method numerically solves the two-boundary value problem and hence computes trajectories for given shocks over a \textit{finite} number of periods. 
		\item If one is rather interested in solving an \textit{infinite}-horizon problem, the easiest way is to approximate the solution by a finite-horizon problem (large $T$). The drawback of this approach is that the solution is specific to a given sequence of shocks, and not generic.  
		\item In case there is more than one lead or lag, Dynare automatically transforms the model in the form with one lead and one lag using auxiliary variables. For example, if there is a variable with two leads $x_{t+2}$:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item create a new auxiliary variable $a$
			\item replace all occurrences of $x_{t+2}$ by $a_{t+1}$
			\item add a new equation: $a_t = x_{t+1}$

		\begin{itemize}
			\item The Dynare language is a markup language for MATLAB/Octave that defines models,

		\item The \textbf{Dynare macro language} adds a programmatic element to Dynare.

			\item It allows to replicate blocks of equations through loops (\texttt{for} structure), conditionally executing some code (\texttt{if/then/else} structure), writing indexed sums or products inside equations, etc.
			\item It is used to speed model development,
			\item and useful in various situations. Examples: Multi-region models, creation of modular mod-files, variable flipping, conditional inclusion of equations, etc.

		\item The Dynare macro language provides a new set of \textbf{macro commands} that can be used in mod-files.
		\item Technically, this macro language is totally independent of the basic Dynare language, and is processed by a seperate component of the Dynare pre-processor.
		\item This macro processor transforms a mod-file with macros into a mod-file without macros (doing text expansion/inclusions) and then feeds it to the Dynare parser.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The macro-processor is invoked by placing \textit{macro directives} in the mod-file. 
		\item Directives begin with: \texttt{@\#}  
		\item The main directives are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \texttt{@\#include}: file inclusion
			\item \texttt{@\#define}: definition of a macro processor variable
			\item \texttt{@\#if, @\#ifdef, @\#ifndef, @\#else, @\#endif}: conditional statements
			\item \texttt{@\#for/@\#endfor}: loop statements 
		\end{itemize}
	\item Most directives fit on one line. If needed however, two backslashes at the end of a line indicate that the directive is continued on the next line.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}<presentation>
	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection\thinspace\thesubsubsection} Introduction to the Syntax (2)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The macro processor has its own list of variables which are different than model variables and MATLAB/Octave variables.
		\item There are 4 types of macro-variables:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item integer 
			\item string 
			\item integer array 
			\item string array
		\end{itemize}
		\item Note that there is no boolean type:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item false is represented by integer zero
			\item true is any non-zero integer
		\end{itemize} 
		\item Further note that, as the macro-processor cannot handle non-integer real numbers, integer division results in the quotient with the fractional part truncated (hence, $5/3=3/3=1$).

		\item The value of a macro-variable can be defined with the \texttt{@\#define} directive.
		\begin{verbatim}
		   @#define Regions = 3
		\end{verbatim}
		\item Macro-expressions can be used in two places:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Inside a macro directive; no special markup is required (as in the example above).
			\item In the body of the mod-file, between an at sign and curly braces (like \texttt{@{expr}}); the macro processor will substitute the expression with its value:
				\begin{verbatim}
				   parameters z;
				   z = @{Regions};
				\end{verbatim}
			In the example above the value of 3 is assigned to parameter z.

		\begin{verbatim}
		   @#include "ModFiles/DGE_CRED_Model_Equations.mod"
		\end{verbatim}
		\item It is equivalent to copy/paste of the content of the included file.
		\item Note that it is possible to nest includes (i.e. to include a file with an include file).
		\item Files to include are searched for in the current directory. Other directories can be added with the \texttt{@\#includepath} directive.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Loops can be implemented using the \texttt{@\#for...@\#endfor} directive.
		\item In a model encompassing multiple regions, loops can faciliate setting up a \text{model} block:
		\begin{verbatim}
		   model;
		   @#for reg in 1:Regions
		        Y_@{reg} = A_@{reg} * (K_@{reg})^alpha 
		                            * (L_@{reg})^(1-alpha);

	\frametitle{{\thesection.\thesubsection\thinspace\thesubsubsection} Introduction to the Syntax (7)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The previous example also illustrates a great advantage of the macro language compared to the MATLAB/Ocatve syntax. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In MATLAB it is not possible to change the index of a variable, for example $Y_r,K_r,L_r$.
			\item Intuition: The Dynare macro as well as basic language rather have the character of a text than code, which is then transforemed by Dynare and MATLAB into a code.
			\item It is also possible to use the MATLAB syntax directly in a mod-file. Dynare simply does not have to translate this part of the file further.

		\item The most basic conditional directive is the if-statement. It is executed by the directive \texttt{@\#if,...,@\#else,@\#endif}.
		\begin{verbatim}
		   @#define RCP_scenario = 4.5 // choose: 4.5 or 8.5
		   parameters Temp_2100;
		   ...

	\begin{itemize}
		\item In the example on the previous slide, \texttt{Temp\_2100} is a parameter representing the temperature in 2100. Its value is assigned using a conditional statement. 
		\item The lines between \texttt{@\#if}, \texttt{@\#else} or \texttt{@\#endif} are executed only if the condition evaluates to a non-null integer (i.e. is true). The \texttt{@\#else} branch is optional and, if present, is only evaluated if all other conditions evaluate to 0 (i.e. do not hold).

\item At the regional and sectoral level are representative firms maximizing profits using capital $K_{k,r,t}$ and labour $L_{k,r,t} = N_{k,r,t} \, Pop_{t}$ provided by households to produce products. 
\item They charge a price $P_{k,r,t}$ for their products and have to pay households wages $W_{k,r,t}$, interest on rented capital $P_{r,k,t} \, r_{r,k,t}$, taxes related to the wage bill $\tau^{N}_{r,k,t}$ and on capital expenditure $\tau^{K}_{r,k,t}$.
\item Representative firms have access to a regional and sector specific constant elasticity of substitution production function.
\item The productivity of capital and labour of a firm in one sector and region depends on the climate variables, and the adaption measures by the government represented by a damage function affecting total factor productivity $A_{k,r,t}$ by $D_{k,r,t} = D_{k,r}\left(T_{r,t}, \, PREC_{r,t}, \, WS_{r,t}, \, SL_{r,t}, \, CYC_{r,t}, \, DRO_{r,t}, \, G^{A}_{r,k,t} \right)$.
\item Further, we explicitly differentiate between climate induced damages affecting labour productivity $D_{N,k,r,t}$ and capital depreciation $D_{K,k,r,t}$. 
\item As in \cite{nordhaus1993optimal}, we assume a polynomial functional form of the damage functions, but the damages are different across regions and sectors.

\frametitle{Regional Production}
\scriptsize
\begin{itemize}
\item At the regional and sectoral level are representative firms maximizing profits using capital $K_{k,r,t}$ and labour $L_{k,r,t} = N_{k,r,t} \, Pop_{t}$ provided by households to produce products. 
\item They charge a price $P_{k,r,t}$ for their products and have to pay households wages $W_{k,r,t}$, interest on rented capital $P_{r,k,t} \, r_{r,k,t}$, taxes related to the wage bill $\tau^{N}_{r,k,t}$ and on capital expenditure $\tau^{K}_{r,k,t}$.
\item Representative firms have access to a regional and sector specific constant elasticity of substitution production function.
\item The productivity of capital and labour of a firm in one sector and region depends on the climate variables, and the adaption measures by the government represented by a damage function affecting total factor productivity $A_{k,r,t}$ by $D_{k,r,t} = D_{k,r}\left(T_{r,t}, \, PREC_{r,t}, \, WS_{r,t}, \, SL_{r,t}, \, CYC_{r,t}, \, DRO_{r,t}, \, G^{A}_{r,k,t} \right)$.
\item Further, we explicitly differentiate between climate induced damages affecting labour productivity $D_{N,k,r,t}$ and capital depreciation $D_{K,k,r,t}$. 
\item As in \cite{nordhaus1993optimal}, we assume a polynomial functional form of the damage functions, but the damages are different across regions and sectors.
